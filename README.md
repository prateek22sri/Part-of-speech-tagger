# Part-of-speech-tagger

Two implementations of part-of-speech tagger. Long implementation uses Viterbi algorithm and the short uses NLTK's HMM function

+ Long implementation is good for understanding how the transition probabilities, emission probabilities and prior probabilities work

+ Short implementation uses NLTK's HMM function which lets you build a tagger in just 4 lines of code
